# Problem Statement: Internal Resource Management System

## Context
Organizations require a robust system to manage their employees from recruitment to relieving. This includes multiple stages such as hiring, onboarding, role assignment, performance tracking, payroll management, and exit processing. Ensuring that each of these stages is handled efficiently while maintaining flexibility, scalability, and adherence to software design best practices is crucial.

## Objective
Design an **Internal Resource Management System (IRMS)** that follows the **SOLID principles** in JavaScript. The system should provide a modular, maintainable, and scalable solution to handle employee lifecycle management from recruitment to relieving.

## Key Features

### 1. **Recruitment Management**
   - Capture job openings with job descriptions, required skills, and experience levels.
   - Manage applications, including applicant details, resumes, and interview schedules.
   - Track interview results and offer management.

### 2. **Employee Onboarding**
   - Store employee personal details, job roles, departments, and reporting managers.
   - Assign necessary resources (laptops, ID cards, email accounts, etc.).
   - Schedule orientation and training sessions.

### 3. **Role and Performance Management**
   - Define employee roles and responsibilities.
   - Implement performance tracking mechanisms, including feedback and appraisals.
   - Manage promotions and role changes.

### 4. **Payroll and Compensation**
   - Maintain employee salary details and deductions.
   - Generate payslips and track tax deductions.
   - Manage benefits like insurance, bonuses, and incentives.

### 5. **Exit Process & Relieving**
   - Handle employee resignation and termination workflows.
   - Conduct exit interviews and gather feedback.
   - Generate experience certificates and relieving letters.
   - Remove system access and recover assigned assets.

## Constraints
- The system must be implemented in **JavaScript**.
- Adhere to **SOLID principles** to ensure clean and maintainable code.
- Use **dependency injection** for managing service dependencies.
- Implement **interfaces (using abstract classes or object composition)** to enforce contract-based designs.
- Ensure **separation of concerns**, avoiding tightly coupled modules.

## Expected Implementation Approach
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each module should handle only one responsibility (e.g., a separate class for Employee, Payroll, Recruitment, etc.).

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - The system should be open for extension but closed for modification (e.g., adding a new benefit type without modifying existing payroll logic).

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering functionality (e.g., different types of employees such as full-time, part-time, and contract employees should be handled using polymorphism).

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Avoid forcing a class to implement methods it does not use (e.g., separate interfaces for Payroll, Performance, and Recruitment management instead of one large interface).

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., use dependency injection to manage service dependencies).

## Deliverables
- A modular JavaScript codebase implementing the IRMS using **SOLID principles**.
- Well-documented classes and modules.
- A simple CLI or API interface to interact with the system.
- Unit tests to validate the correctness of different modules.

## Conclusion
By following the SOLID principles, the IRMS will be **scalable, maintainable, and extensible**, allowing organizations to adapt to changing HR needs efficiently. The implementation should ensure minimal code changes when new features or processes are introduced, thereby reducing technical debt.
