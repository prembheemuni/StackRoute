## **Assignment Case Study: Smart Expense Tracker using TypeScript & Modern JavaScript Concepts**

### **Project Overview**
In this assignment, you will develop a **Smart Expense Tracker**, a web-based application that allows users to track their daily expenses efficiently. This project will incorporate advanced JavaScript (ES6+) and TypeScript concepts along with modern tools like **Webpack, JSON-Server, Fetch API, and Promises**. The goal is to **simulate a real-world expense tracking system** with a focus on modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

### **Problem Statement**
Many individuals struggle with tracking their daily expenses, leading to poor financial management. Existing applications are often complex and cluttered with features that users do not need. Your task is to build a lightweight and intuitive **Smart Expense Tracker**, which allows users to:
- Add new expenses with details such as amount, category, and date.
- View expense summaries categorized by type (Food, Travel, Bills, etc.).
- Retrieve expenses from a **mock backend** (JSON-Server).
- Use **client-side filtering and sorting** for efficient data retrieval.
- Store data persistently using **Local Storage** and sync it with JSON-Server.
- Provide an interactive, responsive UI using **modern JavaScript techniques**.

### **Key Requirements**
1. **User Features**
   - Add a new expense (amount, category, date, description).
   - View all expenses in a tabular format.
   - Filter expenses by category or date.
   - Sort expenses by amount or date.
   - View a summary of spending per category.

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Use **TypeScript** for strong typing and better maintainability.
   - Implement ES6+ features such as:
     - **Destructuring & Spread Operators** (for handling state updates).
     - **Arrow Functions** (for concise callbacks).
     - **Template Literals** (for dynamic UI rendering).
     - **Modules & Import/Export** (for code organization).
   - Use **Promises and Fetch API** to interact with a **mock backend** (JSON-Server).
   - Implement **Webpack** for module bundling and use **webpack-dev-server** for live development.

### **Implementation Guidelines**
#### **1. Setting Up the Project**
- Initialize a project with `npm init -y`.
- Install necessary dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install typescript json-server webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server ts-loader 
  ```
- Configure `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript support.

#### **2. Backend (JSON-Server)**
- Create a `db.json` file to store expenses:
  ```json
  {
    "expenses": [
      { "id": 1, "amount": 500, "category": "Food", "date": "2025-02-28", "description": "Lunch" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Start the JSON server:
  ```sh
  npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
  ```

#### **3. Frontend (TypeScript)**
- Use **Fetch API** to interact with `JSON-Server`.
- Store expenses in Local Storage for offline access.
- Implement **dynamic UI updates** with event listeners.
- Use **Promises and async/await** for API interactions.
